# node-database-template
Basic project to help developers to learn to deal with relational databases.
1 - First step is work with native queries and check it how works, problems,etc.
2 - (Doing) We use another approach with ORM with sequelize, then compare the results with native queries.
3 - (TO DO) We will use a non relational approach with mongoDB.
4 - (TO D) We will use another archtecture to deal with messages with messaging system(RabbitMQ i guess!)
